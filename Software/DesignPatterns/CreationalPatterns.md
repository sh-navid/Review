## Creational Patterns
These patterns deal with object creation mechanisms, trying to create objects in a manner suitable to the situation.

- **Singleton**: Ensures a class only has one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
- **Factory Method**: Defines an interface for creating an object but lets subclasses alter the type of objects that will be created.
- **Abstract Factory**: Creates an interface for creating families of related or dependent objects without specifying their concrete classes.
- **Builder**: Separates the construction of a complex object from its representation, allowing the same construction process to create different representations.
- **Prototype**: Involves creating an object based on a template of an existing object through cloning.
