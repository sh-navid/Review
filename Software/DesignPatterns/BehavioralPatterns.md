## Behavioral Patterns
These patterns focus on communication between objects, what goes on between objects and how they operate, along with how they react to changes.

- **Observer**: A pattern for notifying multiple subscribers about a state change.
- **Strategy**: Enables selecting an algorithm at runtime by defining a family of algorithms, encapsulating each one, and making them interchangeable.
- **Command**: Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with queues, requests, and operations.
- **Chain of Responsibility**: Passes a request along a chain of handlers, allowing multiple objects an opportunity to handle the request.
- **Memento**: Captures and externalizes an objectâ€™s internal state without violating encapsulation, allowing the object to be restored to this state later.
- **Iterator**: Provides a way to access the elements of an aggregate object without exposing its underlying representation.
- **State**: Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
- **Template Method**: Defines the skeleton of an algorithm in the superclass but lets subclasses redefine certain steps.
- **Visitor**: Lets you separate algorithms from the object structure on which it operates.
